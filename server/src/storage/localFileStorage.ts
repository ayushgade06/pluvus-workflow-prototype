// The single, swappable seam for persisting brand-uploaded files (currently the
// Campaign Brief PDF). It stores bytes on the local disk under an `uploads/`
// directory and returns a stable REFERENCE string; only that reference is ever
// persisted in node config — never the bytes.
//
// Intentionally tiny and dependency-free so it can be replaced by an S3 / GCS
// backend later WITHOUT touching the workflow engine, the executor, or the node
// config shape: swap the three functions below (save / read / originalName) for a
// cloud implementation and the reference simply becomes an object key. Nothing
// upstream cares whether the reference points at a local path or a bucket key.

// return an object key here instead — the shape upstream depends on is just
