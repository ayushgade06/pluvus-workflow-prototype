// Structured transition logging (Phase 9, Part 9)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every state transition in the engine must be traceable end-to-end. This
// module emits a single structured JSON line per transition with a stable
// shape so logs can be grepped, shipped to a log aggregator, or correlated by
// instanceId / queueJobId.
//
// The same `source` value that is logged here is also persisted onto the
// STATE_TRANSITION event payload (see runtime.ts), so the timeline and the
// /observability/logs endpoint can reconstruct "who triggered this" without
// reading process stdout.
//
// Design note: this is intentionally dependency-free (no pino/winston) to keep
// the prototype's footprint small. The shape — not the transport — is what
// matters for the observability story.

/**
 * Who/what caused a transition. This is the answer to Phase 9 Part 10's
 * "who triggered the transition?" question and is surfaced in the timeline,
 * logs, and inspector.
