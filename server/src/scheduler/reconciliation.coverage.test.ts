/**
 * H8 — stranded-instance sweep COVERAGE (the review flagged this as unverified).
 *
 * The existing reconciliation.test.ts proves the sweep re-enqueues whatever the
 * (injected) listStuckInstances hands it. What it does NOT prove is that the real
 * selection set — RECONCILE_STATES, the WHERE clause of listStuckInstances —
 * actually INCLUDES the two states a crash-between-commit-and-enqueue is most
 * likely to strand mid-deal: NEGOTIATING and REPLY_RECEIVED. If either silently
 * dropped out of that list, a stranded negotiation would sit invisible forever
 * and no behavioral test would catch it. This file locks the selection set.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. Assert RECONCILE_STATES itself — NEGOTIATING + REPLY_RECEIVED are in it,
 *      the WAITING states and every TERMINAL state are NOT.
 *   2. Drive reconcileStuckInstances end-to-end (injected seam, no DB/Redis) for
 *      both states and assert each is re-enqueued keyed on its own state.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --test src/scheduler/reconciliation.coverage.test.ts
