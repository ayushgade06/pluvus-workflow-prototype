//   3. injectReply — persists the INBOUND Message row + transitions to REPLY_RECEIVED.
//   4. stepInstance — runs executeReplyDetection, which calls the classification
//      provider (mock keyword-based or real LangGraph) and routes to
//      NEGOTIATING / REJECTED / OPTED_OUT / MANUAL_REVIEW.
//
// Phase 7: mockIntent (from harness / manual queue injections) still bypasses
// the classification provider so existing harnesses are unaffected. When
// mockIntent is absent (real Nylas webhook path), the agentProvider routes
// through the ClassificationProvider abstraction.

// H2: DERIVE the allowlist from the single source of truth (the Drizzle enum)
// instead of hand-maintaining a parallel list. A hardcoded copy here drifted from
// the enum — it omitted DEFERRED — so a harness/manual-queue injection of
// mockIntent:"DEFERRED" silently resolved to undefined (→ real-classify path)
// instead of the deferred route. This is the same drift class that once degraded
// every real DEFERRED reply to MANUAL_REVIEW (fixed in 65897d1). Deriving here
// makes it structurally impossible: a new enum member is accepted automatically.
// Exported so the H2 drift-guard test can assert it equals the enum (see
// adapters/classification/LangGraphClassificationProvider.intents.test.ts).
