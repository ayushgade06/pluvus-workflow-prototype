/**
 * Unit tests for the campaign → node-config brand-context fallback (H5).
 * Pure logic — run with:
 *   npx tsx src/engine/campaignContext.test.ts
 *
 * Regression target: imported/legacy workflows reached the LLM with brand
 * context missing from node config, so the agent signed as "Pluvus Partnerships"
 * with no scope even though the campaign row HAD the data. mergeCampaignFallback
 * fills ONLY the missing keys; node config always wins; a null campaign is a
 * no-op.
