/**
 * State-machine transition tests. Focused on the CRITICAL-6 accepting edges: a
 * creator reply can arrive in OUTREACH_SENT (before the scheduler moved the
 * instance to AWAITING_REPLY) or mid-NEGOTIATING. Without a REPLY_RECEIVED edge
 * from those states, injectReply persisted the Message row and then threw on
 * assertTransition — losing the reply on retry. These assert the edges exist so a
 * reply is buffered, not dropped. Pure — no DB. Run:
 *   npx tsx src/engine/stateMachine.test.ts
