// When the output guard blocks an AI-generated draft (a leaked floor/ceiling or
// internal term), the email is NOT sent and the instance routes to MANUAL_REVIEW
// so a human reviews before anything reaches the creator. The negotiation
// executor has an equivalent inline helper; this standalone version lets other
// executors (e.g. Reward Setup) apply the same policy without importing from a
// node module. The offending draft body is deliberately not persisted — only the
// leaked tokens are recorded for audit.

// Partnership, no link, and no Obligation: the creator is owed money with no
// ledger row, no retry, and no reconciliation (the terminal state is excluded
// from RECONCILE_STATES). Instead, route to MANUAL_REVIEW: the deal is NOT
// falsely completed, the brand is emailed (runtime does this on entry), and a
// human can re-run the node to complete the mint. The creator's payout data is
// already persisted (PaymentInfo is PAYMENT_RECEIVED), so nothing is lost.
