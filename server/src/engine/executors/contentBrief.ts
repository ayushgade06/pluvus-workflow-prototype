// Content Brief executor (merged post-negotiation node)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the SINGLE node that runs after a successful negotiation. It merges
// what used to be three nodes (Reward Setup + Payment Info + Content Brief) into
// one, and has TWO phases:
//
//   SEND phase (state ACCEPTED — or legacy PAYMENT_RECEIVED, see below):
//     1. Resolve the finalized offer (agreed fee / commission / deliverables /
//        timeline) from the persisted NEGOTIATION_TURN history + config.
//     2. Mint (or reuse) the secure payout token + hosted-form link.
//     3. Load the campaign brief PDF and attach it.
//     4. Send ONE "Your Campaign Brief" email: finalized terms + payout link +
//        PDF, idempotently.
//     5. Transition ACCEPTED → PAYMENT_PENDING and WAIT for the form submission.
//
//   SUBMISSION phase (state PAYMENT_PENDING, handled by executeContentBriefSubmission):
//     After the creator submits the hosted payout form (routes/payment.ts →
//     runtime.handlePaymentSubmission persists it), mint the money ledger and
//     transition PAYMENT_PENDING → CONTENT_LINKS_PENDING (non-terminal), where the
//     instance waits for the creator's in-thread content-links reply.
//
// Legacy graphs (Reward Setup → Payment Info → Content Brief) still drive this
// node from PAYMENT_RECEIVED with a brief-only email (no offer block / payout
// link, since Payment Info already collected payout). That path is preserved by
// accepting PAYMENT_RECEIVED in the send phase and skipping the payout section.
