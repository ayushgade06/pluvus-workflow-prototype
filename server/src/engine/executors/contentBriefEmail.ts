// Content Brief — "Your Campaign Brief" email copy (merged post-negotiation email)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is now the SINGLE email sent after a successful negotiation. It merges what
// used to be three separate emails (Reward Setup confirmation + Payment Info
// request + Content Brief) into one:
//   1. the finalized offer terms (fee / commission / deliverables / timeline),
//   2. a secure tokenized payout-form link the creator completes, and
//   3. the campaign brief itself (PDF attached by the executor) + optional
//      brand notes.
// NOTE: no manual referral link is rendered here — attribution mints a UNIQUE
// per-creator tracking link (partnership.ts) delivered in the welcome email, so a
// static brand-typed link would be redundant and track nothing.
// Kept as a pure builder (like rewardEmail.ts / paymentEmail.ts) so it is the
// single source of truth for the body and is unit-testable without a DB or the
// file system. The PDF attachment is loaded + attached by the executor; this only
// renders the text.
