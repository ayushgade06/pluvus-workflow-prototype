// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Brand-approval executor (brand-approval gate)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The post-acceptance path for a local_payment execution when the brand-approval
// gate is ON (BRAND_APPROVAL_GATE_ENABLED). It runs on ACCEPTED, INSTEAD of the
// merged Content Brief SEND phase, and holds the deal for the brand's sign-off:
//
//   1. Snapshot the agreed terms + creator profile into BrandApproval (idempotent
//      on instanceId), minting a magic-link token (only its hash is stored).
//   2. Email the BRAND (campaign.notifyEmail chain) the "approve this creator?"
//      email with Approve / Reject magic links. Nothing is sent to the creator.
//   3. Park the execution in AWAITING_BRAND_APPROVAL.
//
// On the brand clicking Approve, the route advances the instance to PAYMENT_PENDING
// via the Content Brief SEND phase (the brief + payout link finally go out). On
// Reject the route halts to MANUAL_REVIEW. Neither the money ledger nor any
// creator-facing email happens in this executor — it is a pure gate.
//
// Idempotency: the BrandApproval insert is UNIQUE on instanceId, and the send is
// keyed by sendOnce. A BullMQ retry re-runs the whole function. Token consistency
// across retries (PLU-118, Calvin review §1) is handled in step 3b: on a retry
// that finds an existing row whose email never went out, the token is ROTATED to
// the one we are about to send (hash + expiry together) so the emailed links match
// the stored hash; on a retry where the email already reserved/sent, the original
// token stays and the send dedupes. Either way the brand always receives links
// that validate against the stored hash.
