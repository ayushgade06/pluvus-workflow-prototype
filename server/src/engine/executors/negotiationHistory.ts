// buildPriorContextFromEvents (above) feeds /negotiate the DECISION history —
// event-sourced by design (why the system decided). It is LEFT UNCHANGED.
//
// The both-sides transcript threaded into /draft (HARD-N2) and /negotiate (F-H1)
// is a different thing: a record of what was actually COMMUNICATED. It must be
// built from `Message` rows, not events, because `event.payload.message` is the
// AI's decision-step DRAFT — it can diverge from the utterance the creator
// actually received (operator edit, template change, a reserved-but-unsent /
// stranded delayed send, an eventless operator/transactional send). Sourcing the
// transcript from events makes the model reason against a history that may never
// have happened. Sourcing it from sent Message rows fixes that.
//
// This builder therefore:
//   - takes OUR side from OUTBOUND Message rows that were actually delivered
//     (`sentAt !== null`) — reserved-but-unsent / stranded / rolled-back rows
//     are dropped (they have `sentAt === null`);
//   - takes the CREATOR side from INBOUND rows (unchanged), via extractReplyText;
//   - ENRICHES each outbound entry with `round`/`action`/`rate` by joining the
//     sent row to its owning NEGOTIATION_TURN event (a Message row has `body` but
//     not those fields) — text/timing are canonical, event fields enrich;
//   - orders by real delivery time (`sentAt` / `receivedAt`, `createdAt` fallback);
//   - carries the source `messageId` for auditability.
//
// `brandReplyMsgIds` are inbound rows that are actually the BRAND answering an
// escalation (A1/A2), not the creator — excluded here so the brand's "approve"
// never appears as a creator turn.
