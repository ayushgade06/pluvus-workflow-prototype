  // (a second reply arrives before we've sent our turn). Without a REPLY_RECEIVED
  // edge, injectReply persisted the row then threw on assertTransition, losing the
  // reply on retry. The edge buffers such a reply into the reply-detection/

  // (which then chains into Content Brief). Both edges are kept. Can be escalated.

  // handoff); a reply with no URLs stays here (self-loop) after a gentle nudge; an
